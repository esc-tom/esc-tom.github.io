      },
      {
        "speaker": "patient",
        "utterance": "Hi. I’m alright, I guess. Just a bit tired."
      },

        "speaker": "therapist",
        "utterance": "I hear you. Anything in particular that’s been on your mind this week?"
      },
      {
        "speaker": "patient",
        "utterance": "The house has been busy. I’ve been trying to keep everything in order, especially the kids’ bedtime."
      },
      {
        "speaker": "therapist",
        "utterance": "That sounds important to you. How have the bedtime routines been going?"
      },

        "speaker": "patient",
        "utterance": "I asked my wife to go over the schedule, but she kept adding her ideas. I felt the plan slipping."

        "speaker": "patient",
        "utterance": "I closed the kitchen cabinet hard and shouted at her. Then I left the room, and the kids were still up."
      },
      {
        "speaker": "therapist",
        "utterance": "That sounds like a strong reaction. What’s been running through your mind since then?"
      },
      {
        "speaker": "patient",
        "utterance": "I keep thinking that if I can’t stay calm now, I’m not the steady parent I try to be. I worry the kids will feel like I’m abandoning them."

        "utterance": "I’ve always kept the house on a schedule. When everything has a place and a time, the chaos feels less threatening."
      },
      {
        "speaker": "therapist",
        "utterance": "It sounds like the schedule feels like a safety net. When that net was tugged, you felt the house might collapse."
      },
      {
        "speaker": "patient",
        "utterance": "Exactly. I thought a clear bedtime plan would let me close the cabinet without thinking about the mess outside it."
      },

        "speaker": "therapist",
        "utterance": "And how did your wife’s involvement feel in that moment?"
      },
      {
        "speaker": "patient",
        "utterance": "I felt like she was stepping on the plan I’d built. It made me defensive, like she didn’t trust my ability to manage things."
      },
      {
        "speaker": "therapist",
        "utterance": "It sounds like there’s a fear that if you let go of a little control, the whole routine could tumble."
      },
      {
        "speaker": "patient",
        "utterance": "I know it sounds extreme, but the thought of the kids noticing me falter makes my chest feel heavy."
      },
      {
        "speaker": "therapist",
        "utterance": "That heaviness you notice—does it show up only when the schedule is threatened, or also in other parts of the day?"
      },
      {
        "speaker": "patient",
        "utterance": "Mostly at night. When the kids are fighting over screens and the clock is ticking, I feel the need to lock everything down."
      },
      {
        "speaker": "therapist",
        "utterance": "You’ve been very organized about bedtime. What might happen if you allowed a small part of that routine to be shared?"
      },
      {
        "speaker": "patient",
        "utterance": "Part of me wonders if giving my wife one bedtime could actually give me a breather, but another part imagines the whole night falling apart."
      },
      {
        "speaker": "therapist",
        "utterance": "It sounds like there are two voices: one that sees sharing as a chance for relief, and another that fears collapse. Which voice feels louder right now?"
      },
      {
        "speaker": "patient",
        "utterance": "Right now the fear is louder. I can hear the kids crying upstairs and it makes the knot in my chest tighten."
      },
      {
        "speaker": "therapist",
        "utterance": "Let’s try a small experiment. Imagine you let your wife handle just the first bedtime tonight. What would you notice in the kitchen while that’s happening?"
      },
      {
        "speaker": "patient",
        "utterance": "I might actually have a moment to wipe the counter without hearing the shouting. It could feel like a brief pause."
      },
      {
        "speaker": "therapist",
        "utterance": "That pause could be a space to notice how the house feels without you holding every lever. How does that possibility feel?"
      },
      {
        "speaker": "patient",
        "utterance": "It feels strange, like giving up a piece of control I’ve always kept. But maybe it’s not a loss, just a shift."
      },
      {
        "speaker": "therapist",
        "utterance": "Shifts can be easier than losing something completely. If the shift works, what might that tell you about your role as the steady parent?"
      },
      {
        "speaker": "patient",
        "utterance": "Maybe being steady isn’t about doing everything myself, but about setting the structure and letting others help keep it up."
      },
      {
        "speaker": "therapist",
        "utterance": "That sounds like a new perspective: steadiness as a framework rather than a solo performance. How could you test that idea tomorrow?"
      },
      {
        "speaker": "patient",
        "utterance": "I could ask my wife to lead the 7‑year‑old’s bedtime routine and see how the night runs. I’ll keep a list of what works and what feels off."
      },
      {
        "speaker": "therapist",
        "utterance": "Keeping a list fits your organized style. It also gives you concrete data instead of imagined catastrophe. Does that feel doable?"
      },
      {
        "speaker": "patient",
        "utterance": "Yes. It feels less like surrender and more like adding a new piece to the plan."
      },
      {
        "speaker": "therapist",
        "utterance": "Great. Let’s check in next time about how that experiment went. Thank you for sharing, Victoria."

        "speaker": "patient",
        "utterance": "Yes. My husband came in very angry. He shouted, pushed past me, and his hand hit the tray. The whole thing tipped over and the bandages fell to the floor."
      },

        "speaker": "therapist",

      },
      {
        "speaker": "patient",
        "utterance": "My hands started shaking. I felt a rush of fear—what if the bandages are contaminated? What if my mother gets an infection? It felt like I was back in that same storm, unable to protect her."
      },
      {
        "speaker": "therapist",
        "utterance": "It sounds like you felt both enraged at his outburst and terrified for your mother’s health. When you think about his temper, what comes up for you?"
      },
      {
        "speaker": "patient",
        "utterance": "I keep telling myself I’m the calm one, the one who keeps things safe. But his shouting made everything feel out of control again, like I’m stuck in a loop I can’t break."
      },
      {
        "speaker": "therapist",
        "utterance": "You’re describing a strong sense of being trapped by his morning fury. What did you decide to do right after the tray hit the floor?"
      },
      {
        "speaker": "patient",
        "utterance": "First I tried to clean up, but my hands wouldn’t stop trembling. I realized I didn’t have a fresh sterile set, so I called the visiting nurse. I told her about the spill and asked if she could check my mother’s wound when she arrives."
      },
      {
        "speaker": "therapist",

      },
      {
        "speaker": "patient",
        "utterance": "I’m using the disinfectant wipes we keep for spills. I’m wiping the floor slowly, counting each swipe, hoping I don’t miss a spot. The wipes are running low, and the echo of his shout keeps looping in my head."
      },
      {
        "speaker": "therapist",
        "utterance": "That echo sounds exhausting. Let’s try a brief grounding exercise: notice three things you can see right now, two things you can hear, and one thing you can feel under your fingertips."
      },
      {
        "speaker": "patient",
        "utterance": "I see the white tiles, the bottle of wipes, a chipped coffee mug. I hear the hum of the refrigerator and the ticking clock. I feel the cool edge of the mop handle."
      },
      {
        "speaker": "therapist",
        "utterance": "Great. How does that feeling change the intensity of the shaking, even just a little?"
      },
      {
        "speaker": "patient",

        "speaker": "therapist",

        "speaker": "patient",

      },
      {
        "speaker": "therapist",

        "speaker": "patient",

      },
      {
        "speaker": "therapist",

      },
      {
        "speaker": "therapist",
        "utterance": "You’re doing the best you can under difficult circumstances. When the nurse arrives, you’ll have a partner in care, and you’ll have already taken steps to protect your mother. How will you remind yourself of that effort after the session?"
      },
      {
        "speaker": "patient",

        "speaker": "therapist",

      },
      {
        "speaker": "patient",
        "utterance": "I told myself I could handle it alone. I didn’t want the kids or the staff to think I was weak. I thought if I just powered through, nobody would notice."
      },
      {
        "speaker": "therapist",

      {
        "speaker": "patient",

      {
        "speaker": "therapist",

      },
      {
        "speaker": "patient",
        "utterance": "I whispered, ‘I’m fine, I’ll manage this.’ It sounded louder in my head than it did out loud. I didn’t want to admit I needed help."
      },
      {
        "speaker": "therapist",

      },
      {
        "speaker": "patient",
        "utterance": "It’s a knot in my chest. I keep replaying the morning, thinking the baby felt every tremor. I’m scared the missed appointment might have caused damage."
      },
      {
        "speaker": "therapist",
        "utterance": "Feeling that knot can be overwhelming. Let’s try a small grounding step before we talk about the next appointment. Could you place your hand on the arm of your seat and notice the pressure for a few seconds?"
      },

      {
        "speaker": "therapist",

      },
      {

        "speaker": "therapist",

        "speaker": "patient",

        "speaker": "therapist",

        "speaker": "therapist",

        "speaker": "patient",

Repeat steps 1‑3 four times total.\n5. After the final exhale, conduct a quick body scan: notice tension in your shoulders, jaw, and chest, and consciously release each area as you breathe out.\n6.

      },

        "speaker": "therapist",

My heart pounded, and the crowd’s panic mirrored that tunnel collapse I keep dreaming about. The whole scene replayed in my mind—metal grinding, that kid’s terrified eyes—over and over, even when I close my eyes now."
      },
      {
        "speaker": "therapist",

      },
      {
        "speaker": "patient",
        "utterance": "I grew up watching my dad run the warehouse. He always said chaos is the enemy of profit, that any slip can bring the whole system down. I internalized that mantra: if I’m not in control, everything collapses. That rule has been my compass ever since."
      },
      {
        "speaker": "therapist",

      },
      {
        "speaker": "patient",
        "utterance": "Exactly. I assumed the commuters would step aside because I’m the one who usually directs traffic. I thought I could cut through like it was nothing, but the aisle was tighter than any warehouse lane I’ve organized. The result was the opposite of my intention—total gridlock and a panic I promised myself I’d never cause."
      },
      {
        "speaker": "therapist",

        "speaker": "patient",
        "utterance": "Every night I hear that metallic screech in my head, like a drill that won’t stop. I wake up checking the aisle in my mind before I even get out of bed. The kid’s face haunts me, and I keep wondering whether I’m the only one who can keep a collapse from happening."
      },
      {
        "speaker": "therapist",
        "utterance": "It sounds like the memory is acting like an alarm system, reminding you of the potential for collapse. At the same time, you’re shouldering the responsibility alone. What does sharing that load look like for you?"
      },
      {
        "speaker": "patient",
        "utterance": "I’m skeptical. Handing the pallet to someone else feels like I’d be signing a death warrant for the shift. If I step back, the whole system might avalanche, and I’d be blamed. My dad’s rule about chaos killing profit still rings in my ears."
      },
      {
        "speaker": "therapist",

      {
        "speaker": "patient",
        "utterance": "I guess I could try delegating a smaller task first, see how the crew reacts. But the fear is that the moment I let go, the metal screech will get louder, not quieter."
      },
      {
        "speaker": "therapist",
        "utterance": "What would it mean for you if the screech softened a little when someone else took a share of the load? How might that shift your internal rule about chaos?"
      },
      {
        "speaker": "patient",
        "utterance": "If the noise lessened, it would feel like I finally gave the system a safety valve instead of a pressure cooker. It might mean acknowledging that my dad’s rule was a bit too extreme—that a well‑trained team can handle a jam without me being the sole guardian."
      },
      {
        "speaker": "therapist",
        "utterance": "That sounds like a promising experiment: treating the crew as additional safety checks rather than potential sources of disorder. How could you start that in your next shift?"
      },
      {
        "speaker": "patient",
        "utterance": "I could brief the team before we load the train, lay out a clear path, and ask one of the newer guys to take the lead on the pallet while I oversee. I’ll watch the flow and note if the crowd stays calmer."

        "speaker": "therapist",

        "speaker": "patient",

Something that isolates a single edge router in a low‑traffic segment, runs latency probes for a short window, and automatically rolls back if we see more than a 5 ms spike.

      },
      {
        "speaker": "therapist",
        "utterance": "Great. You’re balancing the desire to appear competent with a realistic plan to address the issue. Let’s also think about how you might respond internally if a colleague does notice the spot."
      },

        "speaker": "patient",

      },
      {
        "speaker": "therapist",
        "utterance": "That’s progress. Remember, the mind often magnifies a small slip, but the reality in the room is usually much broader. You have the data, the preparation, and now a strategy for the minor distraction."

      },
      {
        "speaker": "therapist",

        "utterance": "Linking them might be your mind’s way of saying the day’s effort didn’t get the ‘seal of approval’ you hoped for. What would it look like if the evening offered just a quiet pause, without needing perfection?"

        "speaker": "patient",

      {
        "speaker": "therapist",
        "utterance": "That’s a good step. When the knot tightens, you might gently note the feeling, then return to that steady hum. We can practice that next time."
